doublerInsert is exponentially faster than doublerAppend. As the input size gets larger, the runtime gets exponentially slower (for doublerAppend).


while push() appends an element to the end of the array, unshift() appends it to the beginning. And the way that arrays are indexed, the latter takes more work

unshift moves every single element over by 1 space (per call) while push() only needs to do that one time. This is why the time complexity for doublerInsert is O(n^2), while doulblerAppend is O(n).
